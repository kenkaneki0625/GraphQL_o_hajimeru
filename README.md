# POKEDEX WITH GRAPHQL

Very basic implementation of GraphQL with React. Me being an Otaku, I had to make a Pokedex. The UI is very generic but this project comes with a custom Pikachu scrollbar!!! Pika Pikaaaa !!!

The repository name is derived from Japanese which means BEGINING WITH GRAPHQL

Took help from [this](https://youtu.be/yKFoAF7J0mc) tutorial for the project.
